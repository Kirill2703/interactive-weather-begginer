## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **3D globe** with clickable city markers, which load and display weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The globe rotates, and cities pulsate with an animation effect, providing a unique interactive experience for users. When you click on a city, it will display weather details, including temperature, wind speed, and other parameters.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – Framework for building the user interface
- **Three.js** – Library for creating 3D graphics
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – API for fetching weather data
- **Axios** – HTTP client for making requests
- **TailwindCSS** – CSS framework (optional)
