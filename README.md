# Interactive Weather Globe

Welcome to the **Interactive Weather Globe** project! This project demonstrates how to create a 3D globe using **Three.js**, integrate weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, and interact with cities by clicking on them to display current weather information. This project is suitable for both beginners and more experienced developers and will help you learn how to work with web technologies, 3D graphics, and APIs.


## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **3D globe** with clickable city markers, which load and display weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The globe rotates, and cities pulsate with an animation effect, providing a unique interactive experience for users. When you click on a city, it will display weather details, including temperature, wind speed, and other parameters.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – Framework for building the user interface
- **Three.js** – Library for creating 3D graphics
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – API for fetching weather data
- **Axios** – HTTP client for making requests
- **TailwindCSS** – CSS framework (optional)
